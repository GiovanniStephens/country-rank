Scraping Cost of Living
-----------------------

Cost of living is scraped off Numbeo.com. There are several functions to get 
the data from the website. The data is then cleaned and used to estimate a cost of 
living distribution using a Monte Carlo simulation.


Scraping Indices
----------------

I also scrape Numbeo.com indices to get pollution, health care, and crime data.


Scraping Climate Data
---------------------

Climate data is scraped from weatherbase.com.
