# Brief Findings

- Spain and Portugal are two really nice countries for retirement for the following reasons:
    - Their climate is not too hot nor too cold. 
    - They are both relatively safe. 
    - (Though not included in this repo) they are not very corrupt.
    - They are cheaper than New Zealand. 
- Georgia is another country that came up for the following reasons:
    - Not too hot nor too cold. 
    - Not too populated.
    - Very good cost of living.
    - Quite safe.
- Morocco came up in the list, but I do not really like the look of it. 
- There are quite a few options in South America if one is willing to put up with a little more danger and corruption. 
- South American countries are quite cheap relative to the rest of the world.
